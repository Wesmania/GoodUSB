# GoodUSB

GoodUSB is a daemon for managing authorization policies for USB devices. It is being developed by an Open Operating Systems Student Society at University of Warsaw (at the moment a team of undergrads) with support from Samsung R&D Poland.

There is nothing here yet, though - right now we're having our exams. Expect a proof-of-concept soon!
