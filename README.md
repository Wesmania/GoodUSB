# GoodUSB

GoodUSB is a daemon for managing authorization policies for USB devices. It is being developed by an Open Operating Systems Student Society at University of Warsaw (at the moment a team of undergrads) with support from Samsung R&D Poland.

We've started discussing the architecture of the daemon, and hope to start churning out some code very soon.
